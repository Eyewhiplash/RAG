    "    \"A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network designed to process data with grid-like topology such as images. It uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features.\",\n",
    "    \"ResNet, or Residual Network, introduces skip connections to allow gradients to flow through deep networks more easily, making it possible to train models with over 100 layers.\",\n",
    "    \"AlexNet was one of the first deep CNNs that showed the power of GPUs in training deep learning models. It uses ReLU activation and dropout.\",\n",
    "    \"Transfer learning allows reusing a model trained on one dataset for a different but related task. Commonly used with large models like ResNet or BERT.\",\n",
    "    \"Backpropagation computes gradients of the loss function with respect to network weights using the chain rule. It enables optimization via gradient descent.\",\n",
    "    \"L1 regularization penalizes the absolute value of weights, encouraging sparsity. L2 regularization penalizes the squared magnitude of weights, promoting smaller weights.\",\n",
    "    \"Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Techniques like dropout, regularization, and early stopping can help prevent it.\",\n",
    "    \"Dropout randomly disables neurons during training, reducing co-dependency between neurons and helping generalization.\",\n",
    "    \"Early stopping halts training when validation loss stops improving, preventing overfitting.\",\n",
    "    \"PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework with dynamic computation graphs, widely used for research and production.\",\n",
    "    \"An epoch is a full pass through the training data. A batch is a subset used to compute one update. Iterations = dataset size / batch size.\",\n",
    "    \"Learning rate determines how big a step gradient descent takes. A high learning rate can overshoot minima, while a low one slows down learning.\",\n",
    "    \"Cross-entropy loss is used for classification, measuring the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels.\",\n",
    "    \"Mean squared error (MSE) is used for regression, minimizing the square of the difference between predicted and actual values.\",\n",
    "    \"ReLU outputs zero for negative inputs and the input itself for positives. It’s simple and effective, avoiding vanishing gradients.\",\n",
    "    \"Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, stabilizing training and allowing higher learning rates.\",\n",
    "    \"A confusion matrix shows TP, FP, TN, FN — it's used to understand classification errors.\",\n",
    "    \"Precision = TP / (TP + FP), recall = TP / (TP + FN), F1-score = harmonic mean of precision and recall.\",\n",
    "    \"Adam optimizer combines momentum and RMSProp. It’s adaptive and widely used.\",\n",
    "    \"RMSProp adapts learning rate per parameter by maintaining a moving average of squared gradients.\",\n",
    "    \"Learning rate schedulers reduce the LR over time or when a metric plateaus. Types include step, cosine, exponential.\",\n",
    "    \"Fine-tuning involves training a pre-trained model further on new data. Often, lower layers are frozen and only top layers are trained.\",\n",
    "    \"Data augmentation creates artificial training examples by altering original data — e.g., flipping, cropping, or color shifting images.\",\n",
    "    \"Autoencoders compress data into a lower dimension (encoding) and try to reconstruct it. They're used for unsupervised learning and denoising.\",\n",
    "    \"GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) consist of a generator and discriminator competing, producing realistic synthetic data.\",\n",
    "    \"Supervised learning involves labeled data. Unsupervised learning deals with patterns in unlabeled data. Semi-supervised uses both.\",\n",
    "    \"K-means clustering groups data by minimizing distance to cluster centroids. It’s unsupervised and assumes spherical clusters.\",\n",
    "    \"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dimensionality by projecting data to directions of maximum variance.\",\n",
    "    \"A transformer uses self-attention to weigh input tokens differently based on context, enabling better sequence understanding.\",\n",
    "    \"The attention mechanism computes scores between tokens to find which ones to focus on. Scaled dot-product attention is common.\",\n",
    "    \"Positional encoding injects order into transformer inputs, since attention alone is permutation-invariant.\",\n",
    "    \"BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is trained using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\",\n",
    "    \"GPT is a unidirectional transformer-based model trained for next-token prediction. It powers many generative NLP systems.\",\n",
    "    \"Tokenization splits text into tokens — often words or subwords — to prepare inputs for NLP models.\",\n",
    "    \"Word2Vec and GloVe are pre-transformer word embeddings capturing semantic similarity. Now mostly replaced by contextual embeddings.\",\n",
    "    \"MLflow is a tool for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment in machine learning workflows.\",\n",
    "    \"Docker is often used in ML pipelines to containerize code and ensure reproducibility across environments.\",\n",
    "    \"A deployment pipeline for ML includes preprocessing, inference, logging, and monitoring. Tools like FastAPI and Flask are common.\",\n",
    "    \"Evaluation metrics depend on task: accuracy for classification, MAE/MSE for regression, BLEU/ROUGE for NLP, IoU for object detection.\",\n",
    "    \"Hyperparameter tuning uses tools like Optuna or Grid Search to find the best combinations of model settings.\",\n",
    "    \"Overparameterization means the model has more parameters than needed. Surprisingly, this often improves performance when combined with good regularization.\"\n",
